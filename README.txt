What have I tried:

Allow login to facebook from a chrome browser page.
1. embed the login in a iframe in the popup. No, iframes not allowed
2. inject code into the popup to detect location url change. Nothing happened
3. listen from the popup for URL chnages. Nope, the url doesn't change when there is a redirect int he popup
4. Redirecting to myself? Doesn't matche the domain in the facebook app set up.
5. changed the app set up to be my chrome-extension:// url. INVAID domain. Foiled again.
